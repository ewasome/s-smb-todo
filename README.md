# React Code Test - Schibsted Norge SMB

## Introduction

We have set up a very barebones React project for you. Among dependencies you will find Typescript, React, Styled Components and React Router. These are libraries we use daily and therefore you want to solve the problem with them. You can add extra dependencies if you feel it's necessary. If so, please explain why.

In the project folder you will find a simple wireframe to explain the app (Wireframe.jpg). Design will not be considered, but we require you to write some CSS. It's up to you whether you want to add functionality beyond what is shown on the wireframe.

The application should fetch the current user from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and automatically assign it to new tasks.

Document your code and choices along the way in the form of comments and/or in `DOCUMENTATION.md`. You do not need to write comprehensive documentation, but enough to help us understand your choices.

## Tasks

You will create a Todo application. Here is a list of features and requirements of the application:

- Use GIT-versioning and commit as you see necessary
- Support at least three Todo lists
- Remember which Todos are in which list
- Remember the status of each Todo
- Creating Todos in each list
- Mark Todos as done / not done
- Automatically assign task to current user
- Delete Todos
- Data should still be available at page refresh
